## Java Installation:
Make sure that Java is installed on your computer. You can download the JDK (Java Development Kit) from the official [Oracle](https://www.java.com/en/) website or use an OpenJDK distribution.

## IDE Installation:
To be able to code, you'll need an IDE. There are quite a few options available, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse. For greater ease and to ensure everyone can easily understand, we'll proceed with Microsoft's VSCode.

Here are the steps to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your system:

- Step 1: **Download**<br/>
  Go to the official [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website.<br/>
  Click on the "Download for [your operating system]" button. Select the corresponding version (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

- Step 2: **Installation**
  - *For Windows:* <br/>
    Run the downloaded installation file.<br/>
    Follow the installer's instructions. By default, VSCode will be installed in the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code" folder.
  - *For macOS:* <br/>
    Open the downloaded installation file (usually located in the "Downloads" folder).<br/>
    Drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the "Applications" folder.
  - *For Linux:* <br/>
    Depending on your Linux distribution, follow specific instructions for installing packages.<br/>
    - For Debian/Ubuntu:
      ```bash
      sudo dpkg -i <path_to_deb_file>
      sudo apt-get install -f
      ```
    - For Fedora:
      ```bash
      sudo rpm -Uvh <path_to_rpm_file>
      ```
- Step 3 : **Launching VSCode**<br/>
  Once the installation is complete, launch Visual Studio Code by clicking on the icon in the start menu or by searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the search bar.

- Step 4 : **Initial Configuration**<br/>
  When you launch VSCode for the first time, you can set up certain preferences and extensions. You can customize VSCode according to your needs by adding extensions, modifying themes, etc.

- Step 5 : **Using VSCode**<br/>
  Once you've launched VSCode, you can start writing code by creating new files or opening existing ones. VSCode provides an intuitive user interface with features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging, version control integration, and much more.

## Writing and Running a First Java Program:
Create a file called **HelloWorld.java** in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.
